# Where in the Triangle

## About

Where in the Triangle is a short game where you try and guess where certain locations are in the Triangle area of North Carolina. The player will first sign in/create an account (made using Firebase). Each play of the game contains 10 questions, each worth up to 1000 points based on how close the player's guess was. The player is given 10 seconds to guess for each question. At the end the total score is tallied and a leaderboard is displayed with the top total scores.
